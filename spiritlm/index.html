        <p>
            We introduce <a id="small-caps">Spirit-LM</a>, a collection of foundation multimodal language models
            that freely mixes text and speech, and are trained jointly with tokens extracted from both speech and
            text corpora. The speech tokens are based on speech units independently capturing semantics, pitch, and
            style information, while the text is encoded with subword BPE tokens. They are concatenated as a single
            set of tokens, and trained with a word-level interleaving method using a small automatically-curated
            speech-text parallel corpus. The resulting models display both the semantic abilities of text models
            and the expressive abilities of speech models. Additionally, we demonstrate that SPIRIT-LM is able to
            learn new tasks in a few-shot fashion across modalities (i.e. ASR, TTS, Speech Classification).

It is visited by over three million people each year. Yellowstone was established as the first national park in the United States on March 1st, 1872 the lake is sometimes referred to as the largest high-elevation lake in the world. It is the largest alkaline lake in the world and the second-largest freshwater lake in the United States after Lake Michigan.

            We prompt the model with an expressive prompt in either

        the expressive style of the prompt onto the contination across
        a change in modality.
